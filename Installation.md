# Installation Process / Setting Up

To install the software running the driver for the MacroKeyboard you need to install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Tested with Python ver.3.10.2).

- Up next we need the PySerial-Library. For this you simply open the commad `pip install PySerial`.
- This process is then repeated with the pynput library `pip install pynput`. This is neccessary to activate some AutoHotkey functions
- (`pip install requests`) - not working yet

after that you can execute the python file
